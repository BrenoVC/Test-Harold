<p class="TweetTextSize TweetTextSize--normal js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="en" data-aria-label-part="0">Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything &amp; they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, &amp; no more testing!</p>

<p class="TweetTextSize TweetTextSize--normal js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="en" data-aria-label-part="0">James Comey’s Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch &amp; others?</p>
